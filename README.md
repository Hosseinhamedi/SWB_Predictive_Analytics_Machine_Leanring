# SWB Workshop: Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning

This repository contains Python notebooks, datasets, and supporting files for the **SWB Workshop on Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning**.

The materials illustrate practical use cases in **regression** and **classification**, showing how predictive modeling techniques can be applied to real-world data.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

 - notebooks/ ‚Äî Jupyter notebooks demonstrating regression and classification workflows

 - data/ ‚Äî Example datasets used in the notebooks

Each notebook provides step-by-step explanations, code examples, and visualizations designed to help participants understand the concepts and workflows in predictive analytics.

## üöÄ How to Use the Notebooks

You can interact with the notebooks in **two main ways**:

### Option 1: Open in Google Colab

 1. Go to Google Colab

 2. Click on the GitHub tab

 3. Copy and paste the following URL into the search bar:
 ```
 https://github.com/Hosseinhamedi/SWB_Predictive_Analytics_Machine_Leanring.git
 ```

 4. Click the spyglass search icon (üîç) at the end of the line

 5. From the list of notebooks, click the square icon with an arrow (‚Üó) to open one in a new browser tab

 6. You need to clone the repo manually in the first cell of the notebook. A the top of the notebook, click on "+ Code" and type:
 ```
!git clone https://github.com/Hosseinhamedi/SWB_Predictive_Analytics_Machine_Leanring.git

%cd SWB_Predictive_Analytics_Machine_Leanring/notebooks
 ```
 7. Click on the "Run cell" icon or use "Ctrl+Enter" keyboard shortcut. 

This method allows you to run and edit the notebooks directly in your browser ‚Äî no installation required.

### Option 2: Download the Repository

#### üß† For Mac Users

 1. Open a Terminal window

 2. Navigate to the folder where you want to download the repository
    For example, to download it to your Desktop:
    ```
    cd
    cd Desktop/
    ```

 3. Clone the repository using git:
    ```git clone https://github.com/Hosseinhamedi/SWB_Predictive_Analytics_Machine_Leanring```

#### üíª For Windows Users

 1. Go to: `https://github.com/Hosseinhamedi/SWB_Predictive_Analytics_Machine_Leanring`

 2. Click the green "Code" button (top right)

 3. Select "Download ZIP"

 4. Open the downloaded .zip file in File Explorer

 5. Click "Extract all"

 6. Edit the extraction path to save the folder to your Desktop

 7. Click "Extract"

## üß∞ Requirements

To run the notebooks locally, install the required Python libraries.
From the main repository folder, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

(If a `requirements.txt` file is not included, install the libraries listed at the top of each notebook.)

## üìò Topics Covered

 - Regression models (linear, regularized, and tree-based)

 - Classification models (logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting)

 - Model evaluation and interpretation

 - Visualization of model performance and feature importance

 - Practical applications using real-world datasets

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Workshop Goal

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

 - Understand the workflow for building predictive models

 - Be able to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance

 - Gain hands-on experience with modern machine learning tools in Python
